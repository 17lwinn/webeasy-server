                    # ProTech WebEasy Server
                        
What is it exactly?
-------------------

This started off a simple test- to see if it was possible to serve files with python,
now it is beginning to turn into a full webserver project- powered by Tea (the drink)
and Flask.


What do I need?
--------------------

You need Flask, and a port available. Plus python (2 or 3, tested on 2)


Who made this?
--------------------

This was made by 17lwinn (protechuk@pm.me) and jarvis394, Jayden and roboticObsession


Can I help?
--------------------

Sure you can! to contribute send a personal message 17lwinn on the glitch.com support
forum. Or DM 17lwinn on discord (mysterious dev#6589). We'll reply with a list of
possible things you could help with.

Please be prepared with extensive python and/or flask knowledge and/or HTML knowledge.

What is manual.txt?
----------------------

Manual.txt is a simple text file containing instructions on using our software, this
is updated as more is added- so we recommend looking at the copy on glitch or github.


Copyrighted?
-----------------------

Yep, see the LICENSE. I'm not a lawyer but know a bit of the law.
