What is it exactly?
-------------------

This started off a simple test- to see if it was possible to serve files with python,
now it is beginning to turn into a full webserver project- powered by Tea (the drink)
and Flask.


What do I need?
--------------------

You need Flask, and a port available. Plus python (2 or 3, tested on 2)
